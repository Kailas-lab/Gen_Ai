    "In LangChain, agents are a powerful mechanism that allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with their environment. They go beyond simply processing text and can make decisions, take actions, and observe the results, enabling them to handle more complex and dynamic tasks. Think of them as giving LLMs \"tools\" and a \"brain\" to use them strategically.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents have access to a set of tools. These tools can be anything that allows the agent to interact with the outside world. Common examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Search engines: To look up information on the web.\n",
    "Calculators: To perform mathematical operations.  \n",
    "APIs: To access data or services (e.g., weather APIs, stock market APIs).  \n",
    "File systems: To read and write files.  \n",
    "Other LangChain chains: Agents can use other LangChain chains as tools, creating a modular and composable system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM acts as the \"brain\" of the agent. It's responsible for:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision making: Based on the current state of the environment and the available tools, the LLM decides which tool to use and what input to provide to it.\n",
    "Planning: For more complex tasks, the LLM might create a plan, deciding which tools to use in what order.\n",
    "Reasoning: The LLM can reason about the results of using tools and adjust its strategy accordingly.\n",
